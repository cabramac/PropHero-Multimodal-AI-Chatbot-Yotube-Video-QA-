In this video, I'm going to show you how we are using data to find the best deals. All right, let's start with the absolute basics. In a very, very simplified view, a great investment property is the property that will increase in value, that's capital growth, and that will provide you with strong cash flows. That's rental return. Again, in a very simplified view, capital growth is about investing in an area where in the future, there will be strong demand and low supply."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,42.24,72.56,"rowth is about investing in an area where in the future, there will be strong demand and low supply. So think about growing population, growing economy, lack of land available, limited space to build new houses. Number two is buying under market price, right? And the idea here is to just negotiate extremely hard to find the best property at the best price. Number three is improvement potential. And here the idea is to buy a property that can gain value over time by making some improvements. So think about renovation, adding a granny flat, adding a fourth bedroom, et cetera."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,72.56,104.48,"e improvements. So think about renovation, adding a granny flat, adding a fourth bedroom, et cetera. Finally, you want to avoid properties with red flags. So think about properties in a bushfire risk area, in flood risk area, properties with road noise or just next to an airport. You want to avoid these red flags because when the market is not very hot, then these properties are very hard to sell. That's in a simplified view how your property will increase in value over time. Now let's talk about cash flows. Cash flows is more straightforward, right? You want to have a high rental yield."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,104.48,136.12,"k about cash flows. Cash flows is more straightforward, right? You want to have a high rental yield. So your rental yield is the annual rent you are receiving divided by the price of your property. Number two, what you want to focus on is in areas with growing rents. And in particular, rents growing above inflation. The starting that you want for cash flows is low expenses. So you really want to avoid properties with swimming pools, with high running costs made of materials that are going to degrade over time. Also you want to avoid properties with big strata costs."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,136.12,166.4,"erials that are going to degrade over time. Also you want to avoid properties with big strata costs. So think about expenses as a measure of your entire cash flows. And finally, what you want to focus on is on properties with low predicted vacancy. And these links to the demand and supply, you want to buy a property that will be really easy to rent. That's of course a very simplified view. In reality, at Prop Zero, we have much more than this. And we use over 100 variables, over 10 million data points to track the entire country."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,166.4,195.08,"e than this. And we use over 100 variables, over 10 million data points to track the entire country. So 15,000 suburbs in Australia, we track the entire country all the time. And here for these variables, think about macroeconomics like population growth, job creation, average income. Think about supply as well, like development applications, zoning, land available, all of this. Think also about distance to public transport, distance to train, distance to schools, the quality of the schools, crime rates, quality of the streets, quality of the property as well."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,195.08,227.64,"s, the quality of the schools, crime rates, quality of the streets, quality of the property as well. So think about, yeah, improvement potential, running costs, scarcity level, all of that. Too many to cite right now, but yeah, we use over 200 variables to identify the best areas and the best properties within these areas. So give you an idea about how it works concretely, our data model in the background. So think about correlation on steroids. So we run thousands and thousands of correlation to understand what are the predictive elements of future growth."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,227.64,258.16,"usands and thousands of correlation to understand what are the predictive elements of future growth. Or what are the indicators we can look at today that will ensure you significantly outperform the market. And so here, for example, we saw that under very specific circumstances, buying in areas with a vacancy rate below 1% is actually a very good indicator of price. Not a silver bullet. There are of course like many, many, many more variables and that's why we use 200 and not just one. But yeah, so just to give you an idea, this is like how we are using data. Now what do we do with it?"
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,258.16,287.32,"ut yeah, so just to give you an idea, this is like how we are using data. Now what do we do with it? So as I was saying, we pack the entire market all the time. And in the entire market, you've got many bad or average or just good properties and just a tiny minority of truly excellent one. So we scan the entire market. We apply our proper algorithm. And then what happens is that we don't share these properties with you straight away. We actually have a team of, as of today, about like 14 property experts and data experts"
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,287.32,320.76,"aight away. We actually have a team of, as of today, about like 14 property experts and data experts who look at these properties and run all the analysis that the data cannot see. So there is a real human component to check every single property with local property knowledge in order to make sure that in the end, we only give you the top 1% deals. And I will say, well, it works. We actually track over time how our clients' investments are performing. And look, average capital growth over the last 12 months. I recorded this video in October 2022."
video,prophero_video_1,PropHero – Intro Video 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3eypjlfrY,320.76,348.04,"ng. And look, average capital growth over the last 12 months. I recorded this video in October 2022. Over the last 12 months, our investments increased by 26% in value. So that's more than twice what happened in the markets. Our rents increased by over 16%, which is 50% above what happened in the markets. Our clients are currently enjoying a 4.7% average yield, which is 35% above markets. So yeah, it just works. Thanks, guys. I hope this was clear. Reach out to your property coach if you have any questions. Thank you. Bye-bye."

We’re talking about understanding the market game, planning your moves, and keeping an eye on those tax details. In this no-nonsense guide, we’re going to break down the jargon and give you practical strategies to rock your investment game. What Are Capital Gains? So, capital gains? A capital gain occurs when you sell an asset for more than what you initially paid to acquire that asset, reflecting the financial success of an investment. Types of Capital"

Types of Capital Gains: Now, let’s chat about short-term and long-term gains. Short-term gains, applicable to assets held for one year or less, incur higher ordinary income tax rates. Conversely, long-term gains, arising from assets held for more than a year, often enjoy preferential tax rates. How Capital Gains Tax Works: Investors are obligated to pay taxes on capital gains, and this tax liability pertains to the tax year in which the investment is sold. The classification of capital gains tax varies depending on the duration of asset ownership. For investors holding an asset for a minimum of 1 year, long-term capital gains tax is applicable to the profits garnered upon the sale of the asset. Investors wi"

Investors with an asset ownership period of less than 1 year are subject to short-term capital gains tax on the profits generated from the asset sale. These two types of gains incur different tax rates. Factors Influencing Capital Gains: Market Conditions: Market conditions significantly impact capital gains by influencing asset valuation, supply and demand, economic trends, and regulatory environments.

Stay in the know, and you’ll make smarter investment moves. Tax Implications: The tax legislation favours individuals with long-term investment horizons (1 year or more), while it poses a disadvantage to those attempting to engage in frequent buying and selling of assets within a short timeframe. It’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the tax implications tied to your gains, aligning with your specific investment strategy. Implementing Capital Gains Strategies: Diversification and Risk Mitigation: Spread your investments like peanut butter on bread.

Proactive portfolio management ensures alignment with your financial goals, fostering sustained growth.
