Hi everyone, I'm Carol. I'm part of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Ecosystems team, part of Investment News at Wales. I'm here at the Sydney Startup Hub today with one of our amazing founders, Pablo, who's the co-founder of Prop Hero. Pablo, tell us a little bit about Prop Hero. So at Prop Hero, we are digitizing all the property investment journey. So our vision is why can't you buy Amazon shares from your phone and you can't buy property anywhere in the world. It's quite an ambitious problem to be solving and a good market to be doing it in. We are very data-bagged. That's where Michael, my business partner, comes from. He's a double degree mathematician, like super bright guy. I strongly believe ideas are worth 10-15%. Like 100% there's... We are very involved. Anyone can have an idea. Yes, this is how you execute it and I think that's where both Michael and I have excelled on bringing the best talent to the team. We recently celebrated our first year anniversary here. Congratulations and you've been at the Sydney Startup Hub for the whole... This is the beginning. Since the beginning. Did you meet any kind of government assistance? Yes, we got the MVP grant, which was great. It really helps a lot, especially with tech resources being so expensive. It definitely helps a lot. You get also from the community, like if you're missing on something, you will share or you will tell it, hey, have you applied for this? Okay, then you best get a bit more. Do you want to tell us a little bit about some accolades you've recently won? Yes, we won the Prop Tech Startup of the year. Congratulations. Yes, helps us building a lot of trust for our clients. We look forward to looking at where Prop Hero is in 12 months time. Thank you very much. And just one last advice. It's a tough journey, as you mentioned before. You have to be ready and committed to not have a vacation or being paid nothing. There's a lot into it, but it fulfills you a lot. That's great. Thank you so much. Awesome. Thank you very much.
